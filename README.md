# Encoder motor control 

A motor encoder is a rotary encoder mounted to an electric motor that provides closed-loop feedback signals by tracking a motor shaft's speed and/or position. Various motor encoder configurations are available such as incremental or absolute, optical or magnetic, and shafted or hub/hollow shaft, among others. The type of motor encoder used depends upon many factors, particularly motor type, the application requiring closed-loop feedback, and the mounting configuration required.

### Basic ingredients
| component | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| DC motor | DC motor encoders are used for speed control feedback in DC motors where an armature or rotor with wound wires rotates inside a magnetic field created by a stator. The DC motor encoder provides a mechanism to measure the speed of the rotor and provide closed-loop feedback to the drive for precise speed control. |
| L293D | L293D motor Driver IC is an integrated circuit that can drive two motors simultaneously and is usually used to control the motors in an autonomous system. This motor driver IC enables us to drive a DC motor in either direction and also control the speed of the motor.

L293D is a dual H-bridge motor driver IC. H-bridge is the simplest circuit for controlling a low current-rated motor. One H-bridge is capable to drive a DC motor bidirectional. L293D is a current enhancing IC. It can also act as a switching device. |
